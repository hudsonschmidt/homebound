# Mission — Homebound

Make every outdoor trip findable. We turn a 10-second check-in into a lifesaving signal—capturing a simple trip plan and ETA, then auto-alerting loved ones and SAR with last-known details if checkout is missed—so searches shrink and rescues start sooner, especially for day-hikers who drive the largest share of park SAR.

Grounded in 25 years of SAR data and beacon outcomes, our north star is to prevent or significantly shorten ~40–50% of U.S. lost-person cases (≈30%+ globally) across hiking, boating, climbing, skiing, and diving—without continuous tracking and with privacy by design.

*“Plan in seconds. Get found fast.”*
